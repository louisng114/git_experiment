## Magic Square
This allows you to generate a 4X4 pandiagonal magic square with four given numbers. (If you add the entries in a row, column, or diagonal (including wrap-around ones), you would get the same sum.)

The four entered numbers will be populated on row 2 column 3, row 3 column 2, row 3 column 4, and row 4 column 3.
